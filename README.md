# Code_Refactor
Pirooz Wallace

Refactored code for accessibility, added descriptive alt attributes to all images. Added semantic html tags, including nav, main, section, aside and footer. Added comments all throughout index.html and style.css for clarity. Grouped and reordered selectors in style.css.

Had a ton of commit messages/comments, but because I setup git wrong (forked repository on Gitlab instead of making repo on Github), I think those commits comments have been lost in this version.
